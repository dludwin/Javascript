Hello, 

This is my GitHub repository on Javascipt connected to Visual Studio. It will be about everything assosiated with JS in general. 
9/20/2020 I'm training solving common algorithms and problems, the sources are 100Algorithms challenge course and Edabit.com (1500) exercises
Next I will probably do HackerRank and Interview Questions. Then integration with websites and React/Vue real-life projects.
