-Hello, I have 2 years of experience programming and currently I've read dozens of books about programming and videos tutorials in C++/Java/Javascript/SQL. And now I want to --specialize in java/js/sql/react only. While doing University stuff, so I will keep uploading now, especially when it's so easy with VSC and Github.
