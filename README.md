Hello, I have 2 years of experience programming and currently I've read dozens of books about programming and videos tutorials in C++/HTMLCSS/Javascript/Node. And now I want to --specialize in JS/react/node only. While doing University assignments, so I will keep uploading now, especially when it's so easy with VSC and Github.

This is my GitHub repository on Javascript connected to Visual Studio. It will be about everything assosiated with JS in general. I'm uploading common algorithms and problems, the sources are 100Algorithms challenge course and Edabit.com (normal+ difficulty) exercises plus some tutorials from excellent website W3Schools.com 
Next I will do HackerRank and Interview Questions. Then integration with websites and React/Node real-life projects.
